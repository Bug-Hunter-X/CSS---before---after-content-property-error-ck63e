The solution is to carefully check the syntax and ensure that all quotes are closed and that the Unicode characters used within the `content` property are valid.  Always validate your CSS to catch these kinds of errors.  Here's how the corrected CSS looks:
```css
/* solution.css */
.element::before {
  content: "This is the correct content.";
}
```
