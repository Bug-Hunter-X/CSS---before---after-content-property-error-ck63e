The CSS property `content` is used with the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements to insert generated content.  However, if the `content` property's value is incorrect or uses invalid characters, it can lead to unexpected rendering issues or errors in the browser's developer console. For example, using an unclosed quote or an invalid Unicode character can cause issues.
